# DSA
so far i have gathered from a friend who works as developer that we definitely DSA to get hired at #Google. 
so my best bet is that we have to do DSA using pen and paper
apologies for this scribbles. i am using this because, i have zero practical experience. i am really dedicated and hard working, i love solving problems but i do not have a bachelor's degree and there are too many fishes in the sea. so i have to assure myself everytime on different aspects of what am i doing. 
so yep coming back to DSA. 
so from chatgpt i gathered that google scouts top-ranked profiles on leetcode. so i have to make leetcode my soul, the air i breathe.
and here are a couple more platforms i can utilize to prove my worth in DSA:
1. leetcode - google scouts
2. codeforces - most respected CP (contraint programming?) platform (ICPC/IOI-level)
3. topcoder - google uses it for internal hiring. will this be useful for me, we'll see.
4. google kick start - coding contests. mmm i didn't  check that out yet. let me see.
5. atcoder - japanese are always clean in everything
   if i am able to master these itself i think i am half way there without a bachelors. let us not complicate life and ignore everything else.
